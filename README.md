# Authentic-User-Detection-on-Social-Media

With social media platforms gradually replacing dedicated news outlets and also acting as an instrument to shape public opinion about important issues, hate speech accounts and bot users are becoming increasingly common in these platforms. The objective of this task is to identify comments that were likely made by such hate speech accounts or bot users and in doing so, the patterns that distinguish a genuine user from them.

The data used for this project is a collection of toxic and hateful comments found on popular social media platforms like instagram. These comments were chosen as they were toxic, racist, sexist, and were phrased in a way that was suspiciously likely to trigger people. The comments picked had to not contain information specific to a post, had to be as generic as possible, and were not questions or rhetorical. Some comments were manually added with high confidence that they were made by a hate speech account or bot user.

Note: The dataset used for this project has intentionally not been provided here, as it contains examples of extreme hate speech and expletives. The code and model in general should be able to work just as well on any similar dataset or task.
